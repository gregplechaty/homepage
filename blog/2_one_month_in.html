      <p>At one month in, I feel comfortable. I haven't missed assignments, and there aren't any exercises that have overwhelmed me for too long. At the same time, as concepts begin to build on each other, I can begin to see how the strength of each block learned matters. To use a cliche metaphor, if my knowledge as a coder is like building a house, I'm trying to build a backyard shed by the end of the summer.</p>
