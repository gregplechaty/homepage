            <h4>When I'm not working or coding, I'm probably exploring Colorado!</h4>
            <p>I moved here in the summer of 2020 and have been having a blast since. Over the summer, I spent my weekends hiking in the Rocky Mountains and biking the many trails crossing the Denver metro area. As the weather cooled off, I switched to running. Recently I picked up downhill skiing for the first time. It's both more challenging and more fun than I had anticipated!</p>
